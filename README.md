# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio of projects that I have completed throughout my coursework in the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree.

This site was built using Express and Pug templates.

## Styling Updates

- Two different fonts to use - a display font for headings and buttons, and a san-serif for body copy.
- Different colors for the sidebar background, text, and button backgrounds.
- Added hover effects to links and buttons.
- Adjusted box-shadows.
